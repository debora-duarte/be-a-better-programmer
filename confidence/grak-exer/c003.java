//This is a Java code.

//Do not be afraid if it looks very different from the other two codes and the languages (Ruby and Javascript) you have seen so far. Programming languages have a lot of similar structures, you will see. But sometimes they also have very different ways of writing the same thing.

//Take a look at the code. Run it. If you cannot find the problem, take the error message and Google it.

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    //Observe how in Java you need to declare the type of the variable, something that you don't have to do in Javascript or Ruby

    int outroTeste = teste + 2;
    System.out.println(outroTeste);
