; This is a Clojure Code and this is how a Clojure comment is written

; This is one of the most different ways you will see in which code can be written. Each statement - a command that tells the computer what to make - starts with a '(' and is closed using a ')'
; I won't get into detail, but it also writes mathematical operations in a different way, like you see it bellow

; As always, don't be afraid. Just google the error message. Clojure is based on Java, so the error messages you will see will mention Java

; If you run the code, the message is printed, but an error message is also shown, there's still something wrong

(def teste 1)
(def outro-teste 2)
(def mais-um (+ teste outro-teste))
(print mais-um) 
(print "It workeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed!")

; clojure é esquisito
; nome da função print bugado
